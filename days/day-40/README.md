---
### Focus

Update architectural documentation to reflect MongoDB and Firebase additions.
### Timebox

~2 hours
### Study

- [System architecture templates](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/)
- [Comparing SQL and NoSQL](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
### Build

1. Update the high-level architecture diagram to include MongoDB and Firebase modules and their interactions with the core system.
1. Document reasons for choosing each technology (RLS vs NoSQL vs Firebase).
1. Identify integration points and data flow between components.
1. Note potential scalability or complexity risks introduced by the new modules.
### Assignments

- Commit updated architecture diagram and design notes in `/docs/architecture.md`.
- Write reflection in `notes/day-40.md` on integration challenges and benefits.
### DoD Checklist

- [ ] Diagram reflects current system topology accurately.
- [ ] Design notes clearly articulate trade-offs and rationale.
- [ ] Reflection captures integration lessons.
### Commit Message

`docs(architecture): update system design with MongoDB and Firebase modules`
### Outcome Artifacts

- Updated architecture diagram and doc.
- Reflection note in `/notes/day-40.md`.
### Self‑Review Questions

- Does the updated design highlight new dependencies clearly?
- Are there alternative approaches that could simplify the system?
