Pause to evaluate the architecture built so far and document high-level design decisions.
### Timebox

~2 hours
### Study

- [Writing effective design documents](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-software-design-doc/)
### Build

1. Identify current assumptions, risks, and potential improvements.
1. Capture key trade-offs made (e.g., state placement, component structure).
### Assignments

- [ ] Risks and mitigation strategies are explicitly listed.
- [ ] Reflection note committed.
### Commit Message

`docs(design): add initial system design outline and reflections`
### Outcome Artifacts

- `docs/system-design-outline.md` capturing current architecture.
- Reflection note in `/notes/day-14.md`.
### Self‑Review Questions

- Are there any unknowns that require deeper research?
- What dependencies or constraints might affect future design decisions?
